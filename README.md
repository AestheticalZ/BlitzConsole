# BlitzConsole
A simple userlib for Blitz3D for creating console windows.

This allows people to make something such as a debug output window, or straight out console based applications without messing with the WinAPI yourself. Its extremely basic so don't expect it to be a full quality, professionally made lib with full CMD featureset.

<h1>Building</h1>

To build, use Visual Studio 2019. Thats it (oh and also don't forget to use a x86 target)
